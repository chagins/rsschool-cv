### About me

Hello! I'm 34 years old. I am very interested in information technology.

After graduating from the Perm National Research Polytechnic University, I worked in various positions: IT support specialist, system administrator, sql developer. 

In the last three months, I discovered web development for myself. I was charmed by the possibility to transition from design to website or application and create something from scratch.

My goal is to become a professional front-end developer.
